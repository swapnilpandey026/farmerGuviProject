# local Farmer Marketing Platform Guvi Project
The Local Farmer Marketing Platform is an initiative to bridge the gap between local farmers and consumers. By providing a user-friendly marketplace, the platform empowers farmers to showcase and sell their products directly, while enabling consumers to support sustainable agriculture and enjoy fresh, locally sourced goods.
